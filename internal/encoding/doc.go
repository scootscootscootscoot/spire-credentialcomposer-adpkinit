// Package encoding holds the phase-1 DER builders for the two target
// extensions.
//
// # Verification standard
//
// A builder may only be wired into the plugin once its exact output bytes
// are pinned by a golden test against an authority independent of this
// package, and it carries malformed-input and fuzz tests. The two
// extensions have different authorities available, so they are at
// different stages:
//
//   - CRL Distribution Points is specified by RFC 5280 §4.2.1.13 and is
//     already implemented by crypto/x509. The golden test builds a real
//     certificate with x509.CreateCertificate and compares byte-for-byte
//     against the extension the standard library emits, so the encoding is
//     verified against a working implementation rather than against prose.
//
//   - The AD SID security extension has no such reference implementation.
//     Its encoding must NOT be inferred from documentation, from the OID,
//     or from a description of the structure. The bytes must come from a
//     real ADCS-issued certificate or an authoritative Microsoft test
//     vector, and a golden test must pin them. Until that fixture exists,
//     the extension builder stays unimplemented — see docs/FIXTURES.md for
//     how to obtain one.
//
// The SID codec in this package is the primitive underneath that extension
// (the binary SID layout from MS-DTYP), not the extension itself. It is
// verifiable on its own terms and does not depend on the pending fixture.
